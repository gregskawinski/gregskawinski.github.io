## ABOUT

The perpetual enigma of Data and Control has been my driving force, leading me to shape my career around comprehending these domains and leveraging this knowledge to construct superior solutions. As I peer into the future, I envision a world where Cloud Computing and Data Warehousing propel a transformative era of Big Data and AI-driven innovation. A surplus of data begets more refined Data-Driven Algorithms, particularly in the realm of Quantitative Trading, where DATA assumes the role of a pivotal strategic asset.

## PORTFOLIO
---
[Password Manager](https://github.com/gskawinski/Python/tree/main/Projects/PasswordManager)

Python-based Password Manager is a command-line tool (CLI) designed to help users securely store, manage, and manipulate their passwords. It provides a range of features, including password generation, encryption, decryption, updating, importing, exporting. Userdata is saved as JSON/BSON file, with file permisions.
The manager uses AES algorithm to encode and decode passwords, BCrypt algorithm for password hashing....

[Simple Shop](https://github.com/gskawinski/Python/tree/main/Projects/MySQLShopCLI)

"Simple Shop" is a command-line application/tool designed to simulate/streamline various aspects of a virtual store. The CLI app is tightly integrated with a MySQL database for seamless operations. The app offers users a range of functionalities, such as creating user profiles, accessing product lists, obtaining product details and reviews, creating orders, managing customer orders, making new payments, and adding new products to the shop inventory. The application uses simulated data in a fake dataset to simulate real-world scenarios.

[IoT system simulator]

IoT project simulates real-time IoT sensor interactions and data handling with database storage, providing a RESTful API for managing sensor data using FastAPI. The API acts as a data gateway, interfacing with a Cassandra Database as the backend to store and retrieve sensor configurations and data. This ensurs efficient solution for managing large volumes of sensor data. Key features include data handling and validation, sensor management (create, update, read, and delete sensor configurations), and a singleton backend to ensure a single instance of the backend for consistency.

[Food System Order](https://github.com/gskawinski/Python/tree/main/Projects/FoodOrderSystem)

Food Orders is a Kafka-based event-driven food ordering system designed for scalability, leveraging Apache Kafka as a central event bus. It utilizes two Kafka topics: one for generating food orders from multiple restaurants concurrently, ensuring real-time processing capabilities, and another for handling order confirmations with email and data analytics. Once an order is received, the transaction unit performs validity checks before storing the raw data in MongoDB. A second real-time data stream is then generated, where the email confirmation unit sends timely confirmations to customers. The system also employs a client for real-time data analytics, extracting insights into customer preferences and business operations.

[Ethereum EVM token analyser ]

Ethereum EVM Analyser is a group of bots developed and deployed on AWS EC2 servers for blockchain event detection and trade signal generation. These bots utilize stream data from JSON RPC providers like Infura or Alchemy to access real-time blockchain data. By integrating multiple APIs such as Etherscan, Dexscreener, and Tokensniffer, they gather additional real-time/historical data necessary for accurate and timely blockchain and DEX trading information (like smart contracts information, recent trade of DEX market trades and order-book depth). The information collected and processed is then filtered using Python Pandas, with data-driven trade signals sent to private investors via Telegram channels. These signals provide detailed metrics such as Token/Coin details, DEX trade links, and token/coin order depth. MongoDB is used for efficient raw data logging and data caching, ensuring quick access and secure storage of the data.
