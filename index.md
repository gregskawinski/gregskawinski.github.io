## ABOUT

The perpetual enigma of Data and Control has been my driving force, leading me to shape my career around comprehending these domains and leveraging this knowledge to construct superior solutions. As I peer into the future, I envision a world where Cloud Computing and Data Warehousing propel a transformative era of Big Data and AI-driven innovation. A surplus of data begets more refined Data-Driven Algorithms, particularly in the realm of Quantitative Trading, where DATA assumes the role of a pivotal strategic asset.
