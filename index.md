## ABOUT
Data and Control always puzzled me, so I dedicated my career to understand it, and to use this knowledge to built better solutions. In fact, with every project I undertook, my passion for data only deepened.

Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to work with a variety of organizations of different sizes, and to apply my skills to a wide spectrum of challenges. This helped me to become a strong control/data/software engineering professional with a demonstrated history of working in an international environment.

During my PhD I have learned analysing complex problems, and means and ways of finding solutions. This led me to understand that, the better we analyze data, the better and faster data-driven decisions we could make. As a result of my studies I have designed and implemented, data-driven control algorithm for 'more electric aircraft concept'. 

During my time at CERN I have acquired lot of experience in the product/software development life cycle. I have worked on numerous projects, where accuracy and efficiency were of serious concern, so data modeling, integration and control was top priority. Those included for example a design of a DSP control architecture that improved the efficiency of the power converter utilisation. Second important project I've been involved to was design and implementation of PLC data-driven protection system for the power systems. It was here that I learned the importance of understanding business needs and translating them into practical, cost-effective data solutions. This involved a lot of collaboration, innovation, and of course, copious amounts of data analysis.

I have dedicated recent years of my professional carrier to understand cloud computing and data warehousing, as these act as the engine for Big Data and AI-driven technological revolution. I was involved in projects with development of a data processing / ETL pipelines based on the cloud computing solutions. In addition, I have spent some time on development of Quant trading strategies. 

Beyond my professional experiences, I'm a passionate advocate for preserving our natural environment.

If you're in need of someone who can turn your data into a strategic asset, feel free to reach out to me via email. I'm always open to new opportunities and love connecting with new people.
