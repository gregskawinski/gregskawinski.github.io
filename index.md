## ABOUT
(Big) Data and Control always puzzled me, so I dedicated my career to understand it, and to use this knowledge to built better solutions. The more I look into the future, the better I see the world where Cloud Computing and Data Warehousing act as the engine for Big Data and AI-driven technological revolution. More data means better Data Driven Algos for Quant Trading. DATA becomes a strategic asset.

```python
if (isAwesome):
  return true
```
